## Overview

Submit is a new Hack Club system that allows YSWS authors to access identity verification information securely.

- No code is required to set this up, you can keep your Fillout/Airtable forms
- You only obtain information that you need
- Participants are declared of what information is shared with you

## How it works

1. On your YSWS website, participants click submission button/link to `submit.hackclub.com/yourprogram`
2. Submit will declare the information you require. Once they agree, theyâ€™ll be redirected to IDV
3. IDV will pass information back to Submit, which will then redirect participants to your Fillout/Airtable form with pre-filled data
